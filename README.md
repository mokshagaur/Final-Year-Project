# SMART MESSAGING TRANSLATOR APP
*Undergraduate Final Year Project*

## Sub-heading

Subject Area and Background:

There are numerous smart messaging apps available to download on the Google Play store. Those apps can be used on varieties of languages. There are also apps available for language translation including Google Translate. But an app integrating both features are rare. A smart messaging app which translates the message in one language to the other as it is being written and sends the translated message to the receiver will be very useful.

 ## Sub-heading

Description:

The main aim of this project is to design and develop a smart messaging android app that enables the user to communicate with people in different languages. The app translates a text typed in one language (for example English) to another language (for example French). The student will be required to familiarise him/herself with and critically evaluate existing technologies for mobile applications development. A background in object-oriented software engineering and Android programming will be useful for this project.


## IDE and Programming Language

Android Studio 3.2.1 will be used.
Java, the object-oriented programming language will be used.
